# Visualize Data with a Bar Chart
This is my implementation of [Free Code Camp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Visualize Data with a Bar Chart project.

[view in browser](https://hankadev.github.io/d3_bar_chart/)

## Objective
Built an app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/GrZVaM/).
Fulfill the below user stories. Give it your own personal style. You can use HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and the D3 svg-based visualization library.

Dataset provided by freeCodeCamp can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/GDP-data.json).

User stories:
* __User Story #1:__ My chart should have a title with a corresponding `id="title"`.
* __User Story #2:__ My chart should have a `g` element x-axis with a corresponding `id="x-axis"`.
* __User Story #3:__ My chart should have a `g` element y-axis with a corresponding `id="y-axis"`.
* __User Story #4:__ Both axes should contain multiple tick labels, each with the corresponding `class="tick"`.
* __User Story #5:__ My chart should have a `rect` element for each data point with a corresponding `class="bar"` displaying the data.
* __User Story #6:__ Each bar should have the properties `data-date` and `data-gdp` containing date and GDP values.
* __User Story #7:__ The bar elements' `data-date` properties should match the order of the provided data.
* __User Story #8:__ The bar elements' `data-gdp` properties should match the order of the provided data.
* __User Story #9:__ Each bar element's height should accurately represent the data's corresponding GDP.
* __User Story #10:__ The `data-date` attribute and its corresponding bar element should align with the corresponding value on the x-axis.
* __User Story #11:__ The `data-gdp` attribute and its corresponding bar element should align with the corresponding value on the y-axis.
* __User Story #12:__ I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding `id="tooltip"` which displays more information about the area.
* __User Story #12:__ My tooltip should have a `data-date` property that corresponds to the `data-date` of the active area.
